# stardewdata
This is a program that converts JSON game data from Stardew Valley to tabular .csv files.

Conversion of game data files to JSON files comes from <a href=https://github.com/LeonBlade/xnbcli">xnbcli</a> by <a href="https://github.com/LeonBlade">LeonBlade</a>, and the assumption in this program is that you already have JSON-formatted filed available. These files typically lack useful organizing structure, such as variables names, which would be useful for data analysis. This program converts the data from JSON to tabular format, while also adding column names.

This is a work in progress. Please let me know if you have any feedback. :)
